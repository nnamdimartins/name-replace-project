# Findreplace_nnamdi Project
For this project, we have already designed our API and we would deploy the NodeJS application on an AWS EC2 instance and access it over the  browser.

# Firstly, we configured an EC2 instance and securely SSH or connect to it. 
- We choose the ideal VPC.
- Selected the prefered Subnet.
- Enabled assingment of public IP by default.
- We selected the prefered security group we also edited and added more security groups, by default it has SSH on port 22 configurations.
- Added HTTP and HTTPS on port 3002 and set source as "Anywhere". This change is saved to enable access from anywhere.
- We go ahead to launch the instance and securely SSH or connect to it.
